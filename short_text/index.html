      <p>Love is so easy now, especially in digital space.
        <br><br>

        Humans originally evolved the ability of love by becoming attached to each other, that is, to help each other survive in the primitive world. Because of this emotional bound, humanity soon dominated the planet.

        <br><br>

        Later on, if we want to show love to someone, we would give a precious object as a token, or we would send a love letter to express the words. Today, we don’t even need any physical touch or value to show love. We keep clicking the like buttons on the phone, we verbally express love so many times in everyday lives. Nothing to do with survival anymore and promises are easily broken.
        <br><br>

        The procedure of showing love seems to become easier and easier.
        <br><br>

        However sometimes, I know I can’t help but double click someone’s photo on social media, just want to show friendliness, but actually feel nothing about the post itself. I think about this behavior, it is really the opposite to “love”, opposite to the original intention of creating the button, also opposite to the feeling itself——I get confused, even question the sincerity of myself——because, first and foremost, the uniqueness of love should be true and honest.
        <br><br>

        Also, when I think about the digital space, the very feeling is that the space is so light, lighter than a piece of paper, lighter than the wings of a butterfly. Sometimes, that lightness gives me fear, because my hands can never hold it, and it may disappear anytime if something happen to the cloud system. I feel insecure about it. The lightness of the space matches its way of expressing love or hate. I keep wondering what is the heaviness of the internet, of the emotion online.
        <br><br>

        In the novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being, Milan Kundera wrote about the love story between Tomas, Tereza and Sabina, to mainly discuss the lightness and heaviness in one’s attitude towards life and love. The intension of this concept in the book makes me think of love might be a solid ball with a couple of flying wings, or might be a transparent bubble but heavy to be held. Love is all about a complicated feeling, a combination in the weight.

        <br><br>

        The truth is, the process of finding or feeling love is always hard, no one can be forced to get it. So many times, I feel anxious about love, about how to discuss it properly, sometimes I even feel sick about this word, since I cannot find other right words to accurately value different levels of my specific feeling.
        <br><br>

        In this case, maybe I should try to become more careful when expressing. I think that’s the only way of showing respect to the things I truly connect.
