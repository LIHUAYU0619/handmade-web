        Diary No.119: maybe i am a cat philosopher

        Meh!~~~~

        <br>
        <br>

        Today is still a boring Sunday, I woke at 3pm this afternoon. When I was sitting in front of the window, I saw Victoria crying, again.
        <br>
        <br>
        I remembered the first time she was holding me while crying, she murmured about how she was tired of this marriage, and she would try her best to escape these shit. Maybe she knew I saw him kissing Solange? Anyway, tears wet my hair at the same time. I didn’t like that feeling. So later on, every time she cries, I will jump away. She cried a lot though.
        <br>
        <br>
        I don’t actually understand much of human’s sensation. It feels kind of stupid for me. Besides, I’ve already noticed that lately she talks with someone on the phone a lot, many times with a smile. She must have a secret lover. But, will this
        guy be better? I doubt. Actually I don't really care.
        <br>
        <br>
        The dog is so stupid, like always. He hasn’t noticed anything at all. I can sense Victoria secretly planning something. Sometimes I was just staring at her, and thinking of human’s life…it’s too much, everything, too much drama, like the TV series I watched.
        <br>
        <br>
        I sit at the window thinking about human-beings, and suddenly feel a little empty inside. Maybe I was a human in my previous life, who knows. …Being a cat may be easy, but being a cat philosopher can be hard. Maybe I should keep simple in mind.
        <br>
        <br>
        Ok, time to sleep~
