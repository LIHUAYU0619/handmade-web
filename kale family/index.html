  <p>
    I bought a bunch of Chinese Kale, and put them in the refridge.
    <br>
    Several days later, I opened the refridge and found the flowers bloomed.
    <br>
    I was surprised and happy but I knew they wouldn't live long...
    <br>
    So I put them on the windowsill, and took pictures for each of them.
    <br>
    This website was dedicated to them: once they were a family.
