    I bought a bunch of Chinese Kale, and put them in the refridge.
    <br>
    Several days later, I opened the refridge and found the flowers bloomed.
    <br>
    I was surprised and happy but I knew they wouldn't live long...
    <br>
    So I put them on the windowsill, and took pictures of each of them.
