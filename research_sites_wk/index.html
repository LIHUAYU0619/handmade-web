          After watching Family Romance, the newest film by Werner herzog, there was an interview of him. He was asked a question about whose love is true, what relationships are real? And then he said two things are essential for his life - one is
          walking, the other is reading. I was a little bit ashamed of that I didn’t do both of them enough. I knew the story, which was long time ago, of him walking from Munich to Paris in order to “save” Lotte Eisner’s life. But since he brought
          it
          up
          again, it suddenly made me rethink about the movement of walking, something related to my corporeal body.
          <br><br>

          Actually the walking he mentioned is especially for long distance traveling on foot. I know I cannot do that, at least now, but I do want to explore more as much as possible. Because I am a person who is really sensitive to physical
          exhaustion
          and body movement. From kindergarten to high school, I was always bad and afraid of PE, and skipped classes by telling the teacher that “I'm on my period”. If it was other people said something good about walking, I would not listen, but it
          was Herzog, so I think ok I’d rather trust him.
          <br><br>

          I start to walk, sometimes just drifting, sometimes has a destination. At the beginning, I feel just bored. I have no feeling towards this city, it is strange for me and not much connection. I have zero interest in those buildings - they
          are
          good but boring. The street is almost empty, very quiet. My mother would love this but I am not. However, since I was also taking picture while walking, I would unconsciously force myself to find fun things to discover.
          <br><br>

          It did have something new, maybe after 2 walks, which never happened before.
          <br><br>

          I started to deconstruct my boredom, the feeling is like you are sitting on a V-E-R-Y slow roller coaster, it already got to the lowest point, then upward is slowly coming. I still don’t like the city view, but I pay attention to the small
          scene on the street: the wedding dress in the showcase, the mushrooms on the trees, the narrow space between two stores where the homeless people sleeping, many dead cicadas, and the reflection of myself in the small pond on the
          street…those
          photos are really normal like anyone else’s in the phone, it’s not cool photograph, no aesthetics, I don’t want to capture anything cool, I hate cool. They are only accompanied with my changing feeling. I am not the child of the city, but
          there
          are certainly people belongs to her, just like every other cities.
          <br><br>

          I think of moment I was walking in Beijing, in New York, in Tokyo, in Chongqing…everywhere I once walked before, and the person I walked with. So lovely I think. Memories are so lovely. I just found that I walked so much, and I actually so
          enjoyed in walking. I just didn’t pay attention to. I look up and to see here and there, every corner should be someone’s memory. The city is truly vividly alive, even though she’s not close to me.

          <br><br>

          Maybe I have more kindness towards to her, towards to myself…

          (I end up here, but have more to write in my mind…)
          <br><br>

          (basically the two sites for me are the parallel operation/movement between mental and physical - between my feet and my thought - my body and my brain.

        Even though the city landscape were really "normal" for me, I still wanted to capture the glimmering of it (from my perspective).
        <br><br>
        Also i recorded my flowing thoughts by phone, haven't orgnized yet...

        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        <br><br>
        After some orgnizing, I was thinking what intervention I can do with those pictures. think about some photograph works and photo books I like...from 26 gas station(1963)&#8595; / every building on the sunset strip(1966)&#8595;..whiskey
        A-Go-Go (sunset strip portfolio) 1976, printed 1995 &#8595;
        <br><br>
        <img src="img/12.jpg" width="25%">
        <img src="img/ARTS_Sunset_1.jpg" width="28%">
        <img src="img/AL00290_10.jpg" width="25%">
        <br><br>
        and..<a href="https://fw-books.nl/product/stephan-keppel-flat-finish/#largeimg" target="_blank">Stephan Keppel — Flat Finish</a> (2017) &#8595;
        <br><br>
        <img src="img/FLAT_FINISH_29_site.jpg" width="40%">
        <br><br>
        Then I tried many ways...different sizes/papers, and thought the binding/layout..
        <br><br>
        <img src="img/IMG_0106.jpg" width="50%">
        <br><br>
        Finally decided the size is 18cm&times;28.5cm, I will use different papers in the book, grey paper for the B&W photos and light smooth paper for color photo, at the end will use kind of news print rough paper for text...different papers mimic
        various materials on the street, in the city. Last picture is the folding of the paper inside &#8595;, i was thinking of putting voice memo here.
        <br><br>

        <img class="nature-1" src="img/Scan 108.jpg" width="100%">

          <button onclick="myShow1.previous()">~previous</button>&nbsp;&nbsp;<button onclick="myShow1.next()">next~</button>
        </p>
        <br>
        Next step...still thinking about the elements i can apply to build connections between pictures/text/vocie recording(in the book), making typeface(**the relationship of img and words, the narrative/memories)...online space for voice memo(?not
        sure), and online presentation for critique...

          -Your dad have another name for “walk”?
          <br>
          What? Walks are walks.
          <br>
          -That’s not fun.
          <br>
          He’s not my real dad.
          <br>
          -I know, but some dads are interesting.

          That’s true, but…
          <br>
          -In my house, “Walks are called ‘strait’.”
          <br>
          “Strait”?
          <br>
          -My old man loved walks. In my composition, I wrote that taking walks was his strait.
          <br>
          “Strait”?
          <br>
          -Wrong word. What I really meant was “trait”.
          My mom was impressed that her little son would make such an amusing mistake. You get what I’m saying?
          <br>
          I do.
          <br>
          -Anyway, we began using “strait” instead of “walks”. Like “I am going on a strait.” Aren’t there things only your family understand?
          <br>
          No, there aren’t.
          <br>
          -Why not?
          <br>
          I told you my parents abandoned me.

          Whose love is true, what relationships are real?
          <br>
          <br>
          Herzog: Well, it’s as difficult as since the dawn of man. In my life, until today, there are two things that guide me, two essentials of real life - pure vida, as the Mexicans say. It’s not purity of life, it’s essential, saturated,
          wonderful,
          full life. And one is traveling on foot when you travel, but nobody does it, so I cannot really advise. And I mean long distance traveling on foot. And I would do it - as I’m a lazy bum like everyone else - I do it for existentially
          important reason. I travelled on foot once from Munich to Paris because an old woman, my mentor, was dying and I wouldn’t like to see her die and I, I walked on against it. And those are the reasons why I would travel on foot. And the the
          other one - and, again, I will speak to deaf ears - is reading. Read. I do not see many films, but I do read. And those who use too much their cellphone and their social media, they don’t read any more. I mean, they read tweets or so, but
          not cohesive, deep reading of an 800-page Tolstoy novel, for example. So I keep…Even to film-makers, and anyone who is…a medical professional, architects, or anyone. I say, “Read, read, read, read, read, read, read, read. And, after that,
          watch a few movies.”
