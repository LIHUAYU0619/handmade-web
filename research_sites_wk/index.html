        Even though the city landscape were really "normal" for me, I still wanted to capture the glimmering of it (from my perspective).
        <br><br>
        Also i recorded my flowing thoughts by phone.

        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        <br><br>
        After some orgnizing, I was thinking what intervention I can do with those pictures. think about some photograph works and photo books I like...from 26 gas station(1963)&#8595; / every building on the sunset strip(1966)&#8595;..whiskey A-Go-Go (sunset strip portfolio) 1976, printed 1995 &#8595;
        <br><br>
        <img src="img/12.jpg" width="25%">
        <img src="img/ARTS_Sunset_1.jpg" width="28%">
        <img src="img/AL00290_10.jpg" width="25%">
        <br><br>
        and..<a href="https://fw-books.nl/product/stephan-keppel-flat-finish/#largeimg" target="_blank">Stephan Keppel ‚Äî Flat Finish</a> (2017) &#8595;
        <br><br>
        <img src="img/FLAT_FINISH_29_site.jpg" width="40%">
        <br><br>
        Then I tried many ways...different sizes/papers, and thought the binding/layout..
        <br><br>
        <img src="img/IMG_0106.jpg" width="50%">
        <br><br>
        Finally decided the size is 18cm&times;28.5cm, I will use different papers in the book, grey paper for the B&W photos and light smooth paper for color photo, at the end will use kind of news print rough paper for text...different papers mimic various materials in the city. Last picture is the folding of the paper inside &#8595;, i was thinking of putting voice memo here.
        <br><br>

        <img class="nature-1" src="img/Scan 107.jpg" width="100%">
        <img class="nature-1" src="img/Scan 108.jpg" width="100%">
        <img class="nature-1" src="img/Scan 109.jpg" width="200%">
        <img class="nature-1"src="img/IMG_0278.jpg" width="80%">
        <br>
        <p>
          <button onclick="myShow1.previous()">~previous</button>&nbsp;&nbsp;<button onclick="myShow1.next()">next~</button>
        </p>
        <br><br>

        Next step...still thinking about the elements i can apply to build connections between pictures/text/vocie recording(in the book), making typeface(**the relationship of img and words, the narrative/memories)...online space for voice memo(?not sure), and online presentation for critique...

          ‚ÄúStrait‚Äù?
          <br>
          -Wrong word. What I really meant was ‚Äútrait‚Äù.
          My mom was impressed that her little son would make such an amusing mistake. You get what I‚Äôm saying?
          <br>
          I do.
          <br>
          -Anyway, we began using ‚Äústrait‚Äù instead of ‚Äúwalks‚Äù. Like ‚ÄúI am going on a strait.‚Äù Aren‚Äôt there things only your family understand?

          No, there aren‚Äôt.

          Whose love is true, what relationships are real?
          <br>
          <br>
          Herzog: Well, it‚Äôs as difficult as since the dawn of man. In my life, until today, there are two things that guide me, two essentials of real life - pure vida, as the Mexicans say. It‚Äôs not purity of life, it‚Äôs essential, saturated,
          wonderful,
          full life. And one is traveling on foot when you travel, but nobody does it, so I cannot really advise. And I mean long distance traveling on foot. And I would do it - as I‚Äôm a lazy bum like everyone else - I do it for existentially
          important reason. I travelled on foot once from Munich to Paris because an old woman, my mentor, was dying and I wouldn‚Äôt like to see her die and I, I walked on against it. And those are the reasons why I would travel on foot. And the the
          other one - and, again, I will speak to deaf ears - is reading. Read. I do not see many films, but I do read. And those who use too much their cellphone and their social media, they don‚Äôt read any more. I mean, they read tweets or so, but
          not cohesive, deep reading of an 800-page Tolstoy novel, for example. So I keep‚Ä¶Even to film-makers, and anyone who is‚Ä¶a medical professional, architects, or anyone. I say, ‚ÄúRead, read, read, read, read, read, read, read. And, after that,
          watch a few movies.‚Äù
