    Hi Eileen,
    <br>
    <br>

    Nice to meet you!
    <br>
    <br>

    I would like to briefly share some works and other things about myself with you :)

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    1)
    <br><br>

    <a href="https://lihuayu.xyz/fragments-in-an-anonymous-building/" target="_blank">Fragments in an Anonymous Building</a> is a website i did for the Third Semster Review. It includes most of my works and some writings.
    <br>(And here is my <a href="https://lihuayu.xyz/map/" target="_blank">mind map</a>.)

    <br><br><br>

    2)
    <br><br>

    <a href="https://lihuayu.xyz/invitation/candidacy-book.pdf" target="_blank">The Experience of Aura</a> is my candidacy book at the end of the second semester, which also comes with a <a href="https://lihuayu.xyz/index/" target="_blank">website</a>.

    <br><br><br>

    <br><br>
    Here is a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UD_kO68UhFDOMAmSPUV-5ShX0uxTvlgG/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">video</a> i made for pechakucha. <br>googoooomuck is another name of mine, which means a teenage vampire.

    <br><br><br>

    4)
    <br><br>

    I enjoy all kinds of art, sometimes they might not be art.

    <br><br>
    I like Walter Benjamin, Virginia Woolf and Barthes.
    I especially like ficitons by Tolstoy, Georges Perec and Enrique Vila-Matas...The structure and language of literature influence my method of working.
    <br>
    I like Rembrandt, Paul Klee and Francis Picabia. (etc)
    <br>
    I like Chris Marker, Alain Resnais, Jacques Rivette, Agn√®s Varda, Raoul Ruiz and Godard. I also enjoy films by Tarkovsky, Werner Herzog, Jonas Mekas and Charlie Kaufman (etc)!
    <br>
    I like poems by Rimbaud. I admire Nietzsche.

    <br><br>
    I like objects and garments.
    <br><br>

    I love insects and all the animals.
    <br><br>
    The last thing...my favorite actress is Juliette Binoche!
